       <p>Recycleabook.com is different than every other book buying company on the market. We were 

founded <strong class="motto">FOR STUDENTS, BY STUDENTS</strong> with one single mission: To help students receive 

the most affordable textbooks on the market. Our wholesale approach, in partnership with 

discount websites like half.com, helps to accomplish this mission.</p><p>

From coast to coast, our entire sales force is comprised of former college students. We have all 

experienced the burden of high textbook prices personally. We feel an obligation and purpose to 

help students obtain access to the materials they need at reasonable prices.</p><p>

What’s not reasonable, in our opinion, is how students usually have no choice but to purchase the 

newest (and most expensive) editions. That is why we encourage our valued faculty customers, 

when possible, to permit the use of previous (and much more affordable) editions for their 

classes. After all, a publishing company only needs to change 20% of a book’s content to 

create a new, more expensive edition. More often than not, this 20% content change is simply 

examples, names and figures.</p><p>

We, as former students, understand. And here at Recycleabook.com, we will continue to fight 

high textbook prices and help students as much as we can - everyday. </p>

<p>Our mission is simple: To help students receive the 

most affordable textbooks on the market. Please 

join our cause. You can make a difference.</p>
