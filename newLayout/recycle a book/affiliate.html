        <p><a href="http://www.recycleabook.co/affiliate/?wp_affiliate_view=signup" target="_blank"><strong>Join our affiliate program</strong></a> and start earning money for every sale you send our way! Simply create your account, place your linking code into your website and watch your account balance grow as your visitors become our customers.</p>
        
<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
<strong>The process is very simple:</strong>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>1. Visitor clicks on an affiliate link on your site or in an email.</li>

<li>2. The visitors IP is logged and a cookie is placed in their browser for tracking purposes.</li>

<li>3. The visitor browses our site, and may decide to order.</li>

<li>4. If the visitor orders (the order does not need to be placed during the same browser session - cookies and IPs are stored up to a configurable amount of time), the order will be registered as a sale for you and you will receive commission for this sale.</li>
</ul>
<br />
