<h2>Book Condition and Pricing</h2>
<h3>What qualifies as a <em>NEW</em> book?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li><strong>New:</strong> book is in brand new condition and has never been used.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What qualifies as a <em>USED</em> book?</h3>
<p> <strong>Like New:</strong> book is in almost new condition (no markings or wear on the book).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What if my book is missing a CD or other supplements that came with the book?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>If the book comes with a CD, workbook, DVD, or other supplement(s), those items are required in order for you to receive full payment. These items are acceptable even if they have been opened and used. If opened or used supplements are included, then designate the book as used no matter what the condition of the book is.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Will I always receive the payment estimated?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>Not necessarily. All books are inspected upon arrival. If they do not qualify as a new or used book then your payment will be adjusted as outlined above. If the book is so damaged that it is not saleable then it will be recycled and you will not receive any payment.
<p>We reserve the right to refuse any buyback order. If it is refused due to a site error, the order will be returned to you at our expense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What if I do not agree with the grading of my book?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>If you have a concern please contact our customer service department via live chat or by email. The grade we assign your book should reflect the new and used criteria as outlined here. We will make every effort to assist you, ensuring that your price accurately reflects our grading criteria. Please note that in selling back your books to us you are agreeing to accept our new and used criteria and the final grade assigned to your book after we’ve received and inspected it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Payment</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How do you pay me?</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Books that Aren’t Quite Books</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What about Annotated Instructor’s, Instructor’s, Free, or Complimentary Editions?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>WE BUY THESE BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>These books have two or more ISBNs listed on the back of the textbook. Check the back of the book and the back of the title page to be sure you enter the correct ISBN.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Process</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What is an ISBN and where can I find it?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>It is the series of numbers below the barcode on the back of a book. If the barcode is obscured by something such as a sticker, the ISBN can be found on the title/copyright page. Each book has its own unique set of numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Why do some textbooks have two ISBNs on the back cover?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>These books usually come with a supplement or are part of a series. The top ISBN is for the book only. The bottom ISBN is for the book and its supplements (or series in its entirety). Please be sure to use the correct ISBN for what you actually have. Incorrectly identifying your book and/or its supplements may result in a different price or no payment at all.</li>
<li>If the book comes with a CD, cassette tape, workbook, video or other supplement(s), those items are required for you to receive full payment. These items are acceptable even if they have been opened and used. If opened or used supplements are included then designate the book as “used” no matter what the condition of the book is.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What if my book doesn’t show up on your list?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>We only buy textbooks that have a resale value. Please only send books that have been authorized through our website.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What if I send books or items not listed on my quote?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>We cannot pay you for these unexpected books or return them to you. They will be donated to charity. Please read about our Social Mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Can I sell more than one book on one order?</h3>
<p> Yes. In fact, please do! You may enter multiple ISBNs on the Sell Books page.</p>
<p> However if you submit multiple orders with large quantities of low-value books, we reserve the right to return them to you at our expense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Shipping Your Books to Recycleabook.com</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Who pays for shipping?</h3>
<p> We do for shipments (on orders of $15 or more) within the US, if you are selling your books to us! We will pay for shipping with either USPS or FedEx for Buybacks; it’s your choice.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, we are not able to provide prepaid labels for shipments from Canada. The shipping would be at your expense and not reimbursable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What are your shipping charges?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>It depends.</li>
</ul>
<p> Are you selling a book to us? We pay (on orders of $15 or more).</p>
<p> Are you returning an item because you changed your mind? You pay for the shipping method of your choice.</p>
<p> Are you returning an item we sent in error? We pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How do I protect my books in shipment?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>Pack your textbooks tightly in a heavy-duty shipping carton. Lay books flat in the box with the spine of the book facing outward. Do not stand books upright. Secure all remaining open areas of the box, including the top, with packing material. We suggest bubble wrap. Seal your packages with packing tape. Do not place newspaper in the box as it will smudge the book and lessen its value.</li>
<li>After the books have been packed, affix our prepaid mailing label. Take the shipment to any post office. You may wish to purchase insurance and/or delivery confirmation for your package. Prepaid shipping via Media Mail ground shipment is provided via your shipping label. If you choose to use a Priority Mail box from the post office this will increase your shipping cost. We will deduct the additional expedited shipping amount from your total payment.</li>
<li>PLEASE NOTE &mdash; It is your responsibility to pack your books in a heavy duty box with packing material and seal completely with packing tape. You MUST include all CDs, disks, booklets and other text supplements with your shipment to ensure proper credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How much time do I have to send the books?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>You should send your books immediately. We only guarantee the price of your quote if you mail the books within 7 calendar days of your quote. After 6 weeks your order will be cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How long will it take my books to get there?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>Media mail is a class of mail designated for books, magazines, and other forms of media. Packages take from one to three weeks to arrive at our location. If you would like to track your package, you may purchase delivery confirmation when you drop off your package at the post office.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What if you never receive my books?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>If you have not received confirmation that we received your package within 30 days of shipping, please contact us via email at: customer.relations@recycleabook.com</li>
<li>We are not responsible for lost or damaged items. You will not be paid for books we do not receive.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What happens if I use a USPS Priority Mail Envelope or Box with the prepaid Media Mail shipping label?</h3>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li>The cost of shipping will be higher. Additional Priority Mail shipping costs, above the prepaid shipping reflected on the Media Mail shipping label, will be deducted from your payment.</li>
</ul>
