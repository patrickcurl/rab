           <p> The high prices of college textbooks are something that most college students, no matter what 

their major, have to deal with—and they can be a costly addition to your higher education 

budget. In fact, recent reports show that the average cost of college textbooks has increased 

812% over the past 30 years, higher than the rise in tuition, and even medical services during the 

same period! These price increases mean that the average cost of textbooks per year, according 

to The College Board, can reach nearly $1,200 per student. However, that cost can be even more 

in fields that have higher-priced textbooks, such as engineering and the sciences.</p>
<p>For some students, textbook expenses are unmanageable, and can prevent them from taking 

certain courses — even courses that are beneficial for their academic success. Some students

even try to succeed in a course without buying the required books, struggling to do the best they

can from class notes. But it’s difficult to do well in such a situation, and students who do not 

have regular access to required textbooks often do poorly in their courses.</p>

<p>The reality is that most college professors assign textbooks because they contain information 

that is essential to the course curriculum, so it’s very important that students have access to those materials. Luckily, there are plenty of lower-cost options and alternatives to the traditional 

textbook purchase, and savvy students can reduce their textbook costs with a little bit of research 

and ingenuity. Check out these cost-saving options to lower your textbook costs:</p>

<ul class="unstyled space">
<li><h4>Purchase used books:</h4> It’s not necessary to buy brand-new textbooks. Most college

bookstores offer used copies at a substantial discount, but if you want to purchase used 

books, it’s best to buy your books early. If you wait until the last minute, you may find 

that there are no used copies left. You can also purchase used books from online retailers 

such as Amazon.com’s Half.com, Barnes and Noble, Chegg.com, eCampus.com, and other 

online sites, as well as students, who often advertise their used books on campus or online. 

However, before you purchase, remember that you may get a copy that has highlighting, 

underlining, notes, and other markings made by previous readers.</li>

<li><h4>Rent books: </h4>One of the more recent options of the past few years is textbook rental, in

which you lease a copy of the textbook from your college bookstore or an online retailer. 

As with used books, there may be markings in rental copies, and it’s also important to 

comparison shop. In addition, keep in mind that it may be cheaper to buy a used copy than

rent a new one.</li>
<li><h4>Choose courses that use free online eTextbooks:</h4> Free online textbooks are increasingly

popular with professors who are conscious of textbook prices and want to lower their 

students’ educational expenses. Even students who do not have a computer or mobile 

device can access these textbooks by using a computer lab at their school. Some eTexts are 

also available as open resources, in which the author has not secured an exclusive copyright 

to allow anyone to copy the source. Check out the Community College Consortium 

for Open Educational Resources for a list of free online textbooks in a wide variety of 

disciplines.</li>
<li><h4>Share Books: </h4>It’s possible to team up with a classmate or roommate to share a book,

and therefore also share the cost, by creating a reading schedule that gives both of you 

adequate time to complete reading assignments. This can be risky, though, because it 

means someone else will have control over the resource and if they lose, damage, or hog 

the book, you won’t get much use out of it. If you do decide to try this, make sure you find 

a partner who is reliable and honest.</li>
<li><h4>Use an older edition: </h4>Publishing companies and authors routinely edit and make changes 

to their textbooks, resulting in new editions every few years. Many students purchase these 

older versions of assigned textbooks at rock-bottom prices to save money, but this too can 

be risky. You may find that assignments are different, there is new material that you don’t 

have access to, or page numbers may be different, leaving you frantically tearing through 

the obsolete book, trying to catch up to your classmates. Before you do this, check with 

your professor to find out if an older version will be acceptable.</li>
<li><h4>Read the copy of the textbook that is on reserve:</h4> Many college and university libraries

hold copies of popularly assigned textbooks in their Reserve department. A reserve book 

is one that you can check out and read in the library itself for a limited period of time, usually two hours. Some professors also put a copy of the book on reserve at the library for 

student use. Check with your professor to find out if there is a reserve copy; if there isn’t, 

ask them to consider placing one there. Professors often get free copies of these books from 

publishers, so they may be able to honor this request.</li>

</ul>
          <p>

These are the most popular and effective ways to reduce textbook costs, though there may be 

some others as publishing technology changes. A little bit of effort on your part can save you a 

lot of money in the long run.</p>
