       <p> Recycleabook.com continually strives to be active and helpful in the community. We proudly 

donate books to projects, libraries and other good causes across the country. Here are some of 

our current partnerships:</p>

<h2>Public Libraries</h2><figure style="width:200px; padding:10px" class="pull-right"><img width="200" src="images/assets/misc/blake.jpg"><figcaption style="font-size:12px; text-align:center;">Blake Nolan, Director of Sales &amp; Marketing for Recycleabook.com, makes a donation at the San Bernardino 

Public Library in San Bernardino, California.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Our team of buyers makes regular stops at public libraries across the country to donate previous 

editions of texts. All books deserve a good home. By sharing them with the public for free, we 

provide a valuable service and source of higher education.
</p>



<h2>Prison Libraries</h2>
<p>

Recycleabook.com has donated more than 10,000 books to prison libraries in the Midwest. There 

are tens of thousands of inmates who genuinely want to reshape their lives, pursue an education 

and contribute to society upon their release. Access to textbooks is a crucial part of that noble 

path.

<h2>Project Inkslinger</h2>

<em>Building libraries

through Project Inkslinger&reg</em>

"A room without books is like a body without a soul" — Cicero 

<p>Mensa and Mensans can give libraries — and entire towns — a soul.

Project Inkslinger® was founded in 1993 to restore a single library, destroyed when the Mississippi 

flooded parts of the Midwest and South, which lacked the resources to re-establish itself. If the program 

was successful, the intention was to later support other libraries that were destroyed by calamity.

</p><p>The program was planned and implemented totally within Mensa — idea conception, book collection, 

preparation of a database for the librarians, and even delivery, with members using their own backs and 

hands to put books on the shelves. Inkslinger was heavily supported by well-respected university librarian 

and Mensan Jean Cooper of Virginia, who helped identify libraries that would otherwise fold up and not 

rebuild and also helped create realistic guidelines for the condition of books donated. Inkslinger was 

founded by Oklahoma Mensan T.J. Lundeen.</p><img src="images/assets/misc/inkslinger.gif" style="padding:10px;" class="pull-left">

<p>"Our goal was to give a town a library and give back its exceptional reading program for children — one 

of the reasons that particular library was chosen", Lundeen said. "It was also important to us to show how 

much we cared for books, for the concept that every child in every place needs to be literate."

The fact that thousands and thousands of books were gathered allowed the refurbishment of part of the 

junior college library in Doniphan Conty and several of the other county libraries. Thousands more of the 

books collected for the original project that could not be delivered went to the next disaster-struck library 

in Grand Canyon, Ariz.</p>

<p>Donated books bear the Project Inkslinger bookplate with Mensa logo. Lundeen still occasionally hears 

from someone who read an Inkslinger book from the original library and finds her through the Web to say 

thank you and to tell her how a certain book changed his or her life.</p>

<p>The face of Project Inkslinger has of course changed over time. It currently supplies information on 

programs that need book donations and is expanding to include more general philanthropic projects. If 

you are interested in volunteering in any facet of the program, contact the Project Inkslinger Coordinator.
