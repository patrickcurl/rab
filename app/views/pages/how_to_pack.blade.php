<p><strong>PLEASE REMEMBER</strong> — You MUST include all applicable cd’s, disks, booklets and other text supplements with your shipment to ensure proper credit.</p>
<p>
Please ensure you have searched each title by its ISBN located on the back outside cover of the book. This ISBN is the basis for our pricing database. Compare the title listing on the packing slip with the book carefully to ensure a match. Be careful not to mistake a regular listing of a title for an alternate listing such as an annotated instructor’s listing or free copy listing.
