       <p>Recycleabook.com is different than every other book buying company on the market. We were

founded <strong class="motto">FOR STUDENTS, BY STUDENTS</strong> with one single mission: To help students receive

the most affordable textbooks on the market. Our wholesale approach, in partnership with

discount websites like half.com, helps to accomplish this mission.</p><p>

From coast to coast, our entire sales force is comprised of former college students. We have all

experienced the burden of high textbook prices personally. We feel an obligation and purpose to

help students obtain access to the materials they need at reasonable prices.</p><p>

What’s not reasonable, in our opinion, is how students usually have no choice but to purchase the

newest (and most expensive) editions. That is why we encourage our valued faculty customers,

when possible, to permit the use of previous (and much more affordable) editions for their

classes. After all, a publishing company only needs to change 20% of a book’s content to

create a new, more expensive edition. More often than not, this 20% content change is simply

examples, names and figures.</p><p>

We, as former students, understand. And here at Recycleabook.com, we will continue to fight

high textbook prices and help students as much as we can - everyday. </p>

<p>Our mission is simple: To help students receive the

most affordable textbooks on the market. Please
